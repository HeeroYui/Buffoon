=======

The basis idea of this project is not set a deep leaning, this is cool...
But we want to look at the next step by using non common way to create a
new methode to "computer thinking".

We need to start dy a simple way, then we will start with audio IO then
here we will base the system of audio recognition (not speech only) and some basic control.


Ideas of architeture:
=====================

The basis data source is caming from some sources:

![Data sources](images/data-sources.png)


The objective is to use the system remotely with a personal server (communication with REST API):

Global organisation (WIP)

Basic Deep learning:

Final library objective:
========================

AI with some capabilities:
	- learn new word
	- write simple program in interpreted language
	- translate sentence
	- play music, video on other application
	- 
	
	



Some usefull library:
=====================

Voice Activity Detection (VAD): https://github.com/jtkim-kaist/VAD
Audio Denoise: https://github.com/jtkim-kaist/Speech-enhancement
Natural Language Processing (NLP): https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair
